# AI Automation with n8n

This repository contains a collection of **AI-driven automation workflows built with n8n**, along with a **Docker-based setup** for running n8n locally.

The focus is on **real-world automation use cases** that combine:
- Data Science and NLP
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- API integrations
- Data pipelines and orchestration

The workflows are designed to be modular, readable and easy to extend.

## Repository structure

- `docker/`  
  Docker-based setup and installation guides for running n8n locally.

- `workflows/`  
  Self-contained automation workflows. Each workflow includes:
  - an exported n8n workflow (`workflow.json`)
  - a visual overview (`workflow.png`)
  - a dedicated README with documentation

- `docs/`  
  Additional documentation and configuration notes.

## Running n8n with Docker

Instructions for running n8n locally using Docker are provided:

- [Docker setup (Linux / macOS)](docker/install-with-docker.md)
- [Docker setup (Windows)](docker/install-with-docker-win.md)

A ready-to-use `docker-compose.yml` file is included.
